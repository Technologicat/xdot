General

The original XDot (version 0.4 by Jose Fonseca) is clearly written and rather easy to understand. Start by examining the classes DotWindow and DotWidget, and it will all make sense.

As of this writing, some features of the modified one could use some refactoring; see TODO.


====================
Integrated resources
====================

This section explains how to update the integrated resources: the help file and the application icon.


---------
Help file
---------

1) Make the necessary changes to help.dot with your text editor of choice
2) Compile the graph into xdot format, using GraphViz:
      dot -Txdot -ohelp.xdot help.dot
3) Open xdot.py, search for "__online_help_xdotcode__=" (without quotes)
4) Paste the content of help.xdot (note the x!) into the string.


----------------
Application icon
----------------

1) Make the necessary changes to xdoticon.svg. Inkscape is recommended for this.
2) When done, save changes and then export the drawing as a 64x64 PNG
3) Convert it to embedded code. Assuming the exported file is called xdoticon.png:
      ./img_to_pygtk.py xdoticon.png >xdoticon_code.py
4) Open xdot.py, search for "APPICON_PIXBUF =" (without quotes)
5) Paste the content of xdoticon_code.py, replacing the old APPICON_PIXBUF.
